    Based on: https://www.cloudmountainfarmcenter.org/upright-fruiting-offshoot-ufo-sweet-cherry-training/
    Spacing: 5-6' (1.5-1.82 meters)
    5 wires, lowest at 20", spaced 18-20 inches (20 inches = 0.5m)
    Start growing at a 45 degree angle
    Remove all buds below first trellis wire
    train at 12 inches (0.3m)
    Space 8-10 inches apart and remove shoots below horizontal (0.2-0.254m)

    Buds are spaced 1-2 inches apart on dwarfing root stock (0.0254m - 0.0508m)
    Branches grow 12-24 inches in one season (mature), 24-36 inches (first 3 years)
      -- (0.305m - 0.61m) and (0.61m - 0.94m)
    Target: 12-24 inches per age_in_years for best cherry production

    For branches under three years they should grow 24-36 inches and have buds every 1-2 inches.
    From an lpy iteration standpoint, that's 24/2 = 12 to 36/1 = 36 growth steps (call it 24)
    So iterations between tying should be around 24/1.7 = 14 (assuming mean bud spacing of 1.7)
